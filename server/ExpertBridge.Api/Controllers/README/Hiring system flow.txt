Hiring System Flow

#Scenario 1: Direct Hire from Contractor Profile
Description:
The client hires a contractor directly from their profile by clicking the "Hire Me" button.
Event Flow:
1. The client clicks the "Hire Me" button on the contractor’s profile.
2. A job object (also referred to as a contract) is created.
3. Relevant statuses and other job-related data are updated as the contract progresses through completion.

#Scenario 2: Hire via Job Posting
Description:
The client posts a job, and contractors apply. The client then selects and hires a contractor from the list of applicants.
Event Flow:
1. The client creates a job posting.
2. Contractors submit applications for the job.
3. The client reviews applicants under a dedicated tab.
4. The client selects a contractor to hire.
5. The client clicks the "Hire Me" button next to the selected contractor’s name.
6. From this point, the same event flow from Scenario 1 applies.
